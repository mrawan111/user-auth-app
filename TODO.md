# TODO: Fix Login 500 Internal Server Error

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Corrected API URL from "MainFunciton" to "MainFunction" in auth.ts
- [x] Enabled fetch for HttpClient in app.config.ts to resolve SSR compatibility warning
- [x] Added detailed logging in login.ts for request, response, and error details
- [x] Enhanced error handling in auth.ts with console logging for debugging
- [x] Updated login.ts to handle OTP tokens and better response parsing based on Postman collection

## Summary of Changes
1. **auth.ts**: Fixed URL typo, added request/response logging, and detailed error logging
2. **app.config.ts**: Added `withFetch()` to `provideHttpClient()` for better SSR support
3. **login.ts**: Added console logs and improved response handling for sessionToken, sendOTPToken, checkOTPToken

## Current Status
- 500 Internal Server Error is resolved (API call succeeds)
- Login now receives a response but may require OTP verification or different response structure
- Added logging to identify the exact response format

## Next Steps
- Test login again and check browser console for the actual API response structure
- If OTP is required, implement OTP verification flow
- Verify credentials are correct and match Postman collection example
